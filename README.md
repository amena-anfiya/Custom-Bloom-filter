This project provides a pure Python implementation of a Bloom Filter, a probabilistic data structure used for fast membership testing. It calculates the optimal bit array size and number of hash functions based on the expected number of elements and desired false-positive rate. The filter uses Python lists to store bits and relies on multiple hash seeds to simulate independent hash functions. Although entirely written in Python, it demonstrates how Bloom Filters work internally without relying on external modules. The code includes functions to add items, check membership, and measure false-positive rates. A built-in test routine evaluates performance, accuracy, and memory usage. This implementation is easy to read, modify, and extend for educational or lightweight use cases. It is ideal for learning probabilistic data structures or experimenting with Bloom Filter behavior. Designed to be simple, transparent, and dependency-free.
